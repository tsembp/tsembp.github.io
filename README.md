# 🌐 Personal Landing-Page [UNDER DEVELOPMENT]

## 📝 Overview:
This project started as a self-paced learning exercise based on a beginner-friendly YouTube tutorial. It introduced me to the fundamentals of creating a simple, responsive landing page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I will continue expanding my knowledge in HTML, CSS and Javascript and with that I will improve the website by adding new sections, new functionalities and more.

## 🛠️ Features:
- Responsive Design to support all screen sizes
- Clear, simple, minimalistic design
- Interactive buttons powered by JavaScript
- Simple animations (available only on desktop for the time being)
